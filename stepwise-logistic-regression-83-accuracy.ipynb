In this notebook, we are going to use this method on finding the best predictors among the available variables to predict the probability of mortality (```DEATH_EVENT```) by heart failure. The package used in this notebook is the pROC package to generate the ROC and AUC. The modelling part is done using built-in stats package in R."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This R environment comes with many helpful analytics packages installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/rstats Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-rstats\n# For example, here's a helpful package to load\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(pROC)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nlist.files(path = \"../input\")\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Import Dataset\nThe dataset is imported from Kaggle, with 299 observations and 13 variables.
